There's a color I love,
Tis the azure above,
The good old Bishop Blue.
There's nothing quite like it,
The other don't strike it,
The good old Bishop Blue.

Good old Bishop Blue,
Good old Bishop Blue,
A little piece will make a man
Feel just as good as new.
We put a strip up here, you see,
To show our heart beat true.
The best school in the Union
Is good old Bishop Blue.

As long as we live,
The best we will give,
To the good old Bishop Blue.
Be loyal forever,
Dishonor it never,
The good old Bishop Blue.
