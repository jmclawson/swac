High on a throne with royal mien,
Our Hope and our mother stand.
All gaze with pride upon the scene
High o'er the silv'ry strand:
All gaze with pride upon the scene
Where our hope and our mother stand.

Dear Langston, Dear Langston
Thy sons and daughters brave
Will strive on with courage
Their honored shine to save
With a "Sis! Boom! Bah! And a Hip! Hurrah!"
With a "Hip-hur-rah!"
We rally to Langston, Dear Langston, to thee.

If ever man should dare bring low
Thy blazoned banner high,
We'll battle with the vicious foe and for thy honor die.
We'll strive and overcome the foe or for thy honor die.
