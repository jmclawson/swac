From her eastern windows shining
Comes the promise of the day.
Huston-Tillotson, Alma Mater,
Gentle guardian of the way.
From the weary plains and lowlands,
Proudly to her hill above,
Huston-Tillotson, Alma Mater,
Lift our hearts in faith and love.

Founded on the Rock Eternal,
Looking ever tow'rd the light,
Wise in mind and great in spirit,
Holding fast her vision bright.
Come you loyal sons and daughters,
Strong and free your voices raise
To Huston-Tillotson, Alma Mater,
In blessing, gratitude, and praise.
