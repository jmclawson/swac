Forever like a beacon light
May Paul Quinn College ever stand?
To guide the human race aright
And bless and brighten all the land.

Paul Quinn College, son of our souls,
We will strive to bring you fame each day that time unfolds.
Inspired by God and man, you are our shrine beyond compare
Paul Quinn, our dear alma mater fair.

From North and South, from East and West
Your sons and daughters strong and fair
Stand true in life's refining test -
Resolve the right to do and dare.

As sons and daughters ever devout,
May we resolve the best to be?
And o'er our foes within, without,
March on to signal victory.

And when at last we've won life's day,
A great and strong triumphant throng
Shall chant in heav'n in full array:
Paul Quinn, our Alma Mater song.
