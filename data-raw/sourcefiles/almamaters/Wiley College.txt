Oh, Wiley dear, ever we'll sing thy praise:
With love and rapture our voices we'll raise.
Our hearts are all swelling with joy sublime;
We'll cherish thee till the end of time.
We'll cherish thee till the end of time.

Oh Lord, we pray, may our dear Wiley stand;
A beacon light shining o'er our dear land
And may her sons with steadfast purpose true;
Go forth inspired glorious deeds to do.
Go forth inspired glorious deeds to do.
